<div class ="ABH">About Me</div>
<div class="abp"><p>
  <p>My name is Charlie Cockerell.</p><br/>
  <p></p>I am a Lambda School student in the full stack web developer program. I aspire to create interesting and useful products.
</p><br />
<p> Pretty much everything interests me to some degree but with regard to programming, however artificial intelligence, decentralized computing and biocomputing are areas that stand out as lifetime-term areas for mastery (or even proficiency). 

  <br />
<br />I love art (especially complex, busy pieces) and unique perspectives on life... 

<br />

<br />and believe that eternal curiosity is pretty much one of the best things one can have.

<br />
<br />In my spare time, I am usually driving on the freeway with my wife and son talking about random topics.</p>
